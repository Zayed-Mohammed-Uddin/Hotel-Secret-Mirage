# Hotel-Secret-Mirage

Basically this project is developed to showcase the owner's design and structure skills. By the way, I am still learning things, I get forth of me and I aspire to be a professional one. This is my second project. As per Zhankar Mahbub, a newbie should complete at least of 3 projects with only front-End part, if he/she truly wants to be a great webDev. Following that, I have just accomplished my second project and the third one will be on its way.

# Thanks for visiting my project.
